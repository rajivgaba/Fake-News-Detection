The legislation would provide $36.5 billion in emergency relief as Puerto Rico in particular struggles to regain electricity and other basic services following destructive hurricanes. The House of Representatives approved the bill earlier this month. The Trump administration already has indicated it will seek another round of emergency relief from Congress. \",\n          \"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - About a thousand Hungarians protested on Friday against a crackdown on the main opposition party Jobbik which has been  threatened by a record political campaign fine that the party leader describes as a  death sentence  for democracy. Despite the gloomy rhetoric and Jobbik saying it was fighting for survival, support for the demonstration was well down on other similar rallies over the past year. Hungarians will vote for a new parliament in April and Prime Minister Viktor Orban s conservative, anti-migrant Fidesz party is far ahead in the polls, with Jobbik its nearest rival. Jobbik, once on the far right, has turned toward the center in a bid to attract more support and is now campaigning nationwide against Orban, depicting him as the leader of a criminal gang. Orban, rejecting the charges, says his financial standing is  an open book . Last week the state audit office (ASZ) ruled Jobbik had bought political posters far below market prices, breaching rules on political funding, then it slapped a 663 million forint ($2.5 million) penalty on the party. The protesters, waving Jobbik flags and posters deriding the ruling elite, gathered outside the headquarters of Orban s Fidesz party.  What we see unfolding is not an audit office investigation. It is not an official penalty. This is a death sentence with Jobbik s name on it. But in reality, it is a death sentence for Hungarian democracy,  Jobbiik leader Gabor Vona told the crowd. A government spokesman could not comment immediately on his remarks. ASZ chairman Laszlo Domokos is a former Fidesz lawmaker, whom Jobbik and other critics accuse of making decisions in favor of Orban. The audit office denies that. On Friday, ASZ again called on Jobbik to submit information that would challenge its findings, saying it acted fully within its rights throughout the probe. The ruling Fidesz party and the government have denied any involvement in the ASZ probe.  This case has nothing to do with the election campaign,  Orban aide Janos Lazar said on Thursday. For over a year Fidesz has targeted Jobbik, whose move to the center could upend the longstanding status quo of a dominant Fidesz with weaker opponents to its left and its right, said analyst Zoltan Novak at the Centre for Fair Political Analysis. Gyorgy Illes, a 67-year-old pensioner attending the rally, said he used to be a Socialist supporter but got disillusioned as the party struggled to overcome its internal divisions.  This ASZ probe is a clear sign that Orban is way past any remedy. It is a ruthless attack on everything we hold dear. Democracy, the rule of law, equality, you name it,  he said. \",\n          \"BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) - China accused the United States on Thursday of interfering in its internal affairs and said it had lodged a complaint after U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law an act laying the groundwork for possible U.S. navy visits to self-ruled Taiwan. Tensions have risen in recent days after a senior Chinese diplomat threatened China would invade Taiwan if any U.S. warships made port visits to the island which China claims as its own territory. On Monday, Chinese jets carried out  island encirclement patrols  around Taiwan, with state media showing pictures of bombers with cruise missiles slung under their wings as they carried out the exercise. On Tuesday, Trump signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for the 2018 fiscal year, which authorizes the possibility of mutual visits by navy vessels between Taiwan and the United States. Such visits would be the first since the United States ended formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979 and established ties with Beijing. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said while the Taiwan sections of the law were not legally binding, they seriously violate the  One China  policy and  constitute an interference in China s internal affairs .   China is resolutely opposed to this, and we have already lodged stern representations with the U.S. government,  Lu told a daily news briefing. China is firmly opposed to any official exchanges, military contact, or arms sales between Taiwan and the United States, he added.  Proudly democratic Taiwan has become increasingly concerned with the ramped up Chinese military presence, that has included several rounds of Chinese air force drills around the island in recent months.  Taiwan is confident of its defenses and responded quickly to the Chinese air force drills this week, its government said, denouncing the rise in China s military deployments as irresponsible. Taiwan presidential spokesman Alex Huang, speaking to Taiwan media in comments reported late on Wednesday, said the defense ministry had kept a close watch on the patrols and responded immediately and properly. Taiwan  can ensure there are no concerns at all about national security, and people can rest assured , Huang said. Both sides of the narrow Taiwan Strait, which separates Taiwan from its giant neighbor, have a responsibility to protect peace and stability, he added.  Such a raised military posture that may impact upon and harm regional peace and stability and cross-strait ties does not give a feeling of responsibility, and the international community does not look favorably upon this,  Huang was quoted as saying. Relations have soured considerably since Tsai Ing-wen, who leads Taiwan s independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, won presidential elections last year. China suspects Tsai wants to declare the island s formal independence, a red line for Beijing. Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China but will defend Taiwan s security. Taiwan is well equipped with mostly U.S. weapons but has been pressing for more advanced equipment to deal with what it sees as a rising threat from China. The United States is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself. China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 716,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"September 2, 2017 \",\n          \"February 2, 2017 \",\n          \"November 24, 2017 \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Photo: Jim Fiscus/SHOWTIME Previously, we showed how the Hollywood hit ZeroDarkThirty was a completely fabricated piece of fiction which was passed on to the public as a  true story . Also, the popular TV series, Homeland, is one of the most obvious propaganda productions in recent years, designed to reinforce many flawed assumptions and false believes about the world outside of the United States.Did you know that the CIA has actually produced a number of high-profile  history  TV programs that appear on US and world media channels?Yes, it s true SputnikThe Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has a finger in every pie including  the entertainment business: it turns out that the CIA has played a role in producing at least 22 entertainment projects; investigative journalist Adam Johnson argues that by doing this the US intelligence agency puts American media workers at risk.It seems that the US Central Intelligence Agency follows the theory that says that there are no little or insignificant things.  The intelligence agency has long been keeping an eye on the Western entertainment industry and has even had a role in producing popular fiction movies and documentaries.In his article for Fair.org media watchdog investigative journalist Adam Johnson argues that this type of collaboration may cast a shadow over the image of US media workers and even put them at risk. For years, artists from across the entertainment industry  actors, authors, directors, producers, screenwriters, and others  have been in touch with the CIA to gain a better understanding of our intelligence mission,  the CIA public website reads.According to the website, the CIA s goal in engaging with the industry is to ensure  an accurate portrayal of the men and women of the CIA, and the skill, innovation, daring, and commitment to public service that defines them.

I have highly valued the mission of the Choir to be good-will ambassadors for Christ, to share beautiful music and to give hope, inspiration, and comfort to others,  she wrote, explaining why she refuses to sing for Donald Trump on Inauguration Day. I ve tried to tell myself that it will be alright and that I can continue in good conscience before God and man. But it s no use. I simply cannot continue with the recent turn of events. I could never look myself in the mirror again with self respect. I also know, looking from the outside in, it will appear that Choir is endorsing tyranny and fascism by singing for this man. Tyranny is now on our doorstep,  she continued.  I only know I could never  throw roses to Hitler.  And I certainly could never sing for him. Predictably, conservatives threw a collective hissy fit and have sent threats and hateful messages to Chamberlin.And right-wing radio host Ben Ferguson threw his own temper tantrum on live television.Ferguson smeared Chamberlin as a hypocrite and claimed that she sang with the choir at President Obama s inauguration, and viciously criticized her throughout his rant. Was the choir endorsing abortion when they sang when Barack Obama was inaugurated?  he began.  Because he s in favor of abortion. I think that would be something, obviously, she just stepped out from if she s going to claim this holy high ground now. This is nothing but a grandstanding individual who doesn t get her way so she says I m going to walk away. There are 360 people in the choir. Not all are going to be traveling. More importantly than that when it comes to religion you would think she may actually want to have influence over people that are about to run the government and have peace and harmony which is what the Tabernacle Choir claims to be about. This is nothing but self-righteous grandstanding from a crybaby who never grew up. And guess what? Not everyone believes everything you believe in. It seemed like Bolduan had just let Ferguson get away with slandering Chamberlin and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. In fact, the segment continued as Symone Sanders defended Chamberlin against Ferguson s attack but his blatant lie remained unchallenged.But at the end of the segment, Bolduan finally pounced and informed Ferguson that the Mormon Tabernacle Choir never actually performed at President Obama s inauguration.Clearly busted, all Ferguson could manage to utter was,  Well, there you go. Here s the video via YouTube.It s not enough to call out lies. It s time to punish pundits who blatantly lie on the air like Ferguson did. Facts matter and if we want to make sure facts continue to matter, we need to pressure the media to keep people who lie off the air. If they can t be bothered to tell the truth, they have no business being given a platform to spread their bullshit.Featured image via screenshot\",\n          \"The unexpected passing of Justice Antonin Scalia has added yet another layer to the incompetence Republicans display when it comes to governing. This time, however, it s not about a spending issue or an executive order they don t like; there s no looming shutdown or invented ebola crisis. This time, the GOP is threatening the very core of our democracy.Rachel Maddow is without a doubt one of the most brilliant and influential political minds of our time. Her thoughts are insightful and her opinions intertwined with logic and reason. In other words, she s the Anti-Hannity or O Reilly, Limbaugh, Beck or any other of a host of propagandists spewing the lie of the day.In this segment, Maddow breaks down why Republican obstruction of an Obama Supreme Court nominee is not only incredibly arrogant, it s also very dangerous for us as a nation. Our democracy is built on a government of three branches. When one of those branches can t function because of the ongoing threat of a tie, anything from abortion law to gun control and yes, even the outcome of a presidential election could hang in the balance.Watch Rachel Maddow make a case for just how dangerous it is to go into a national election with a vacant seat on the Supreme Court:Many of us wake up in a cold sweat after nightmares of the outcome of the 2000 election. The Supreme Court was ultimately left to decide the fate of American politics for the next four years and the result was disastrous. But, there was a result.What would happen if there was a 4-4 tie in the Supreme Court after a state like Florida was contested? The decision would then revert back to the lower court s decision, which had already been accepted for review by the higher court.The resulting circle of legal quagmire could leave us facing severe consequences, especially when Republicans figure out they can send their appeals strategically to lower court judges they know will side with them automatically.Without the 9th seat on the Supreme Court filled we can expect legal battles to arise in districts where there should be none, simply because the judges of that circuit will be able to negate the wishes of the people with no recourse from the high court.And the kooks of the right think Obama had a good reason to have Scalia assassinated?Featured image from screen capture \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1692,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Mar 17, 2017\",\n          \"May 6, 2015\",\n          \"Aug 2, 2016\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Yes, she filed the petition and yes, she paid the fee, but the state needed to do this even without Stein s request. A new analysis in the Washington Post discovered significant voting anomalies in several wards.Trump now leads Hillary by just over 22,000 votes in Wisconsin. The WaPo analysis didn t look at precincts or counties   they looked at wards, which are the smallest unit where votes are counted. This helped create a more detailed picture of what s happening there.Walter Mebane, an associate researcher at the Center for Political Studies and a professor of political science and statistics at the University of Michigan, looked at small wards that used optical scanning technology, and found that certain features in the vote tabulations reveal the possibility that these counts were tampered with.For instance, using a method called  last digit diagnostics,  Mebane found that the tabulations he looked at should have last digits that, when averaged together, show a mean of around 4.5. Lower could mean that the counts were manipulated.In the small wards he looked at where optical scanning tech was used, the last digit diagnostics reveal a mean average much lower than 4.5.Another statistic Mebane looked at was how often the last digit of a vote tabulation was zero, or five. If there are no problems, then the mean average of that variable should be around 0.2. Larger could mean someone was sloppy, and smaller could mean votes were manipulated.In these small wards, that number was significantly smaller than .2 for Hillary, meaning that the vote counts show a last digit of zero or five far less often than they should.He also found evidence of something called  signaling  in the tabulations, which is when fraudsters leave a type of trail that more or less claims credit for the fraud. Mebane points out that this is actually a fairly common tactic amongst fraudsters in Russia.Finally, a simple test revealed something called  multimodality,  which could show that someone was receiving fraudulent votes. These small wards exhibited that anomaly, too.None of this is absolute proof of election fraud or vote fraud in Wisconsin, and Mebane is careful to note that. However, it gives credence to the need for a recount, whatever Jill Stein s motivations are. If nothing else, conducting a thorough recount will lend further legitimacy to our democratic process or concretely reveal problems that need to be fixed. It might also serve to weaken Trump s efforts to undermine our democracy by repeatedly crying  FRAUD!! FRAUD EVERYWHERE!! The recount begins today.Featured image by Darren Hauck via Getty Images\",\n          \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia\\u2019s Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed in a meeting on Tuesday that Iran represents a regional security threat, a senior adviser to the deputy crown prince said The adviser also said the talks marked a \\u201chistorical turning point\\u201d in U.S.-Saudi relations. Saudi Arabia had viewed with unease the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama, whom they felt considered Riyadh\\u2019s alliance with Washington less important than negotiating a nuclear deal with Iran in 2015. It has been encouraged by the Trump administration\\u2019s hardline stance on Iran and its nuclear program. \\u201cThe meeting today restored issues to their right path and form a big change in relations between both countries in political, military, security and economic issues,\\u201d the senior adviser said in a statement. \",\n          \"SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson flew to Asia accompanied by only one journalist on his aircraft, a reporter from a website founded by former Republican political operatives, in a departure from decades of practice. Tillerson, who became the top U.S. diplomat under  Republican President Donald Trump in February, traveled to Mexico and Germany last month with a small contingent of journalists, including a \\u201cpool\\u201d reporter who informed colleagues of Tillerson\\u2019s statements or actions. The journalist on Tillerson\\u2019s plane that arrived in Tokyo on Wednesday, Erin McPike of the Independent Journal Review (IJR), was not acting as a pool reporter. State Department Acting Spokesman Mark Toner said in a statement that there was only one seat available on Tillerson\\u2019s plane for media. The department had previously told reporters covering Tillerson\\u2019s trip to South Korea, Japan, and China that he would not be taking reporters on his plane and that they would have to fly commercially, breaking with decades of precedent stretching back to Henry Kissinger. \\u201cIt was decided to take a journalist from an outlet that doesn\\u2019t normally travel with the Secretary of State, as part of an effort to include a broader representation of U.S. media,\\u201d Toner said. \\u201cWe will also make every effort to include a contingent of media on the Secretary\\u2019s plane going forward.\\u201d The State Department originally said that Tillerson could not accommodate the usual contingent of reporters because of space constraints. It also said the decision to travel without reporters was intended to cut costs. News organizations pay the U.S. government for the cost of their travel. The journalists who reported Tillerson\\u2019s landing in Tokyo on Wednesday evening traveled there on commercial flights. Depending on the number of staff Tillerson chose to take to Asia, the Boeing 737 he traveled on could likely have accommodated more than one reporter. The conservative-leaning IJR said in a statement late on Tuesday that the State Department last week offered the seat on Tillerson\\u2019s plane. McPike is a White House correspondent for IJR, and previously reported for CNN, Real Clear Politics, NBC News, and National Journal, according to IJR\\u2019s website when she joined in February. She was also briefly part of the team that covered the 2016 election campaign for Reuters. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t take this opportunity lightly and recognize the controversy surrounding press access for the trip,\\u201d IJR founder and chief executive Alex Skatell said in a statement. In 2014, Skatell told The New York Times he wanted to start a site after observing a gap in reaching \\u201ca more mainstream center-right audience.\\u201d The State Department Correspondents\\u2019 Association said in a statement that it was \\u201cdisappointed\\u201d Tillerson chose to travel to Asia without a full contingent of media \\u201cor even a pool reporter\\u201d and called for access to Tillerson equal to that given by the reporter on the plane during his trip to Asia. Tillerson, a former chief executive with the Exxon Mobil oil  company, faces a tough first trip to Asia seeking to reassure nervous allies facing North Korea\\u2019s growing nuclear and missile threat and press China to do more on perhaps the most serious security challenge confronting Trump. For decades, secretaries of state have nearly always invited media to travel with them. In rare cases, particularly late in a secretary\\u2019s tenure, some news outlets have declined, such as former Secretary John Kerry\\u2019s December 2016 trip to Saudi Arabia. Republican secretaries of state Alexander Haig, George Shultz, James Baker, and Condoleezza Rice routinely took 10 or more journalists on their overseas trips, even to war zones. Before founding IJR, Skatell worked for the National Republican Senatorial Committee and for the Republican Governors Association, according to his LinkedIn profile. Another founder, Phil Musser, was once executive director of the Republican Governors Association and worked in the Department of Housing and Urban Development in the administration of George W. Bush.  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2408,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Oct 29, 2015\",\n          \"Nov 12, 2015\",\n          \"March 1, 2016\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"news_label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

So much for that  Christian Morality  that Evangelicals argue makes them better than people of other faiths and none.61-year-old Garry Meyer was the trusted treasurer of Tri-County Baptist Church in West Chester Township, Ohio for 14 years. What his church did not know, is that he was actually cooking the books, spending nearly a million dollars of church money on drugs, lavish holidays, expensive cars, pornography and  high end  escorts for more than a decade.While maintaining the pretense of a god-fearing, responsible, married father, Meyer lived a rock star lifestyle on the side   and his church community picked up the tab.But, sadly for Meyer, his wife uncovered the crime. Under pressure, he made a confession to the church. The only problem was, he  confessed  to stealing $400,000. Once the full investigation was complete, Meyer was exposed as a liar all over again. The full sum stolen was twice that figure.Meyer s wife sobbed in the courtroom as her husband s exploits were exposed, and he was sentenced to five years in prison. He told the court: There is no excuse for my actions, I also want to say I am sorry to my family. I have caused unimaginable hurt and suffering, Turning to his wife, Meyer said: I am sorry for betraying your trust   you have always been the best part of my life. Meyer stole nearly a million dollars from his own congregation in order to fund a lifestyle to which his church is supposed to stand opposed. Also speaking at Meyer s sentancing hearing was colleague Pastor Brian McManus, who said: Our church family has continued to pray for everyone involved in this very sad event. The truth is, our life choices always come down to personal   not religious   morality. A person bent on making the wrong decisions in life, will do so with or without the bible. This lesson is everywhere   from child-abusing priests, to chumps like Garry Meyer, and on to so-called Christian Conservative leaders who lay the sin of wrath upon anyone who fails to follow their warped Ayn Randian version of God.Featured image via video screen capture\",\n          \"SENATOR FEINSTEIN Shocks CNN Anchor With \\u201cPrecise Answer\\u201d On Trump/Russia Smear Campaign [Video] What s all the fuss about if there s no there, there?

Nothing. Not a single thing. A few more months and then they will quietly say  case closed  and hope and pray that we all forgot. Sorry but we won t and we watch you all very differently now, we see right through you. Our patience is just about out and your time handling our power is up. FEINSTEIN EMBARRASES HERSELF DURING QUESTIONING TO NEIL GORSUCH:Senator Dianne Feinstein is no match for Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch. In her questioning today she really made a fool of herself when she tossed out a question that made it clear she hadn t done her homework on Gorsuch. He answered her question by citing numerous specific cases in his legal history. It s understandable that the Democrats are trying to play to their base by dragging out the process of asking ridiculous questions of this perfect nominee for the SCOTUS. This is embarrassing and we have two more days of it!
